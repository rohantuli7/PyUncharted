# PyUncharted

**To design and implement an object-oriented adventure game scenario in python by taking inspiration from the PlayStation game, Uncharted. The overall objective of the game is to locate blue sap of a tree, which when ingested makes the drinker nearly invincible.**

In order to simulate the working of Uncharted, few missions from the game are taken and respective classes based on those missions are created. Each of these classes depict a level to be completed by the user. Only after successful completion of the respective level, the user will be allowed to move to the next level (in terms of code, the object of the next level will only be initialized after a current level is completed without any hinderance).

The application developed is a game in all senses. It contains 8 levels and each of these levels have a small game within itself. Each of these games are independent and unique from the others in terms of code as well as functionalities. Few of the levels might overlap with the others but have a unique flavor in them.
